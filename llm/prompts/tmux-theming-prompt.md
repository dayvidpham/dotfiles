/aura:epoch Is there some way to change the prefix for tmux programmatically? Like I have two modes. On one mode, I have it as Ctrl+Space, then on another mode I have it as Alt+Space. The use-case is that I have a split keyboard with a different layout at one of my workstations, and the Alt+Space is inconvenient when using this split keyboard. I should be able to swap by hitting some keybind. I would also like a visual indicator (colored) to tell me what keybind mode I'm in.

The other request I have: because it is confusing to jump between directories in the sessionizer, I often lose track of where I am. For tmux sessions that are in a certain directory, I would like to colour the background pane based on which git repo that I'm in. I have about ~3-5 that I'm developing actively in, so having some hard-coded registry is fine for now. When I enter a repo that is tracked in the registry, it changes the pane to the associated color. Also, when I am in a git worktree, it should display the git worktree name in the pane title, and there should be some other visual indicator (border color?). What are all the visual decorations or themings I can apply to tmux? is there some collection of "riced out tmux references" I can look at?
